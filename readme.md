# express-honeypot

Express honeypot is a honeypot for remote file inclusion (RFI) and local file inclusion (LFI).<br />
The aim of this project is to catch bots and malwares that are scanning websites and try to upload remote files.<br />
Those RFI / LFI bots use a list of google dorks in order to search the web for vulnerable website.<br />
Express honeypot uses 310 fake urls based on RFI LFI dorks and serves them dynamicaly.<br />
Every request to any of the honeypot urls is logged and the remote file is downloaded and safely stored.<br />
This honeypot is written in javascript and uses express as web server.<br />
A light logs viewer page is available at /beekeeper but I think it needs to have more commands.<br />
Developement is still in progress but the core architecture won't change so you are safe to start using it.<br />

## How to use

Clone the project and install the dependencies :<br />

    git clone https://github.com/christophe77/express-honeypot
    cd express-honeypot
    yarn install

Edit _/express/config.js_ file.<br />
_port_ is the port for the web server.<br />
_beekeeperCredentials_ username and password to access /beekeeper url.<br />
_remoteFileSave_ choose to save the remote file on your local drive, on dpaste or on both of them.<br />
_googleVerification_ is the key given in google search console to validate your website.<br />

Once installed you can start the app with :<br />

    yarn start

## How it works when deployed

The app starts a web server, generate a sitemap with known vulnerables paths from phpBB, joomla,....<br />
When a visitor opens an url and tries to include a remote file, the informations about the request are stored inside a json file in the _/express/hive_ directory.<br />
The remote file used for the inclusion is downloaded inside the hive folder with a .bee extension _/express/hive/files/YYYY-MM-DD/filename.ext.bee_<br />
When an url is opened, a fake page is display with some basic html tags, random text and some SEO for google bots.<br />
If the page is opened with a remote file inside the url then the content of the file is added to the response body as if the injection worked.<br /> It's displayed in text and no real injection is posible.<br />
If you want your honeypot to be effective you need to spread it over search engines.<br /> Google search console is the best option to start.<br />
When you want to check the logs you have to go to _your-website.com/beekeeper_<br />

## How to add more fake urls

If you want to add urls you have to open _/express/pages.js_ and add new datas.<br />
